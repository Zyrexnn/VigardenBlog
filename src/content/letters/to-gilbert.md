Major Gilbert,

Do you remember what you said to me? "Live... and be free."
I did not understand what those words meant at the time. But now, after meeting so many people and writing so many letters, I think I am beginning to understand.

I have learned that "I love you" is a very complicated emotion. It can be warm, it can be painful, and it can give you strength.

I want to see you. I want to tell you that I now understand what you meant.

Sincerely,
Violet Evergarden
