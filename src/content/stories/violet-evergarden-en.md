      Rising from the ashes of a gruesome continental war, there was a young girl recognized not as a human, but purely as a "weapon" of destruction. Devoid of the warmth of memories, devoid of tears, and devoid of a voice in her own heart. Her name was Violet Evergarden.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-up">
      Amidst a grotesque battlefield painted in blood and engulfed in roaring flames, Violet fought desperately for Major Gilbert Bougainvillea—the singular existence who had treated her with humanity. As a storm of bullets shattered her arms and the cathedral roof collapsed, the mortally wounded Gilbert pushed Violet away from the jaws of certain death.
    </p>

      "Live... and be free. From the bottom of my heart, I love you."
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-up">
      Violet survived the massacre, but lost everything. Awakening in the embrace of cold, metallic prosthetic arms, she found herself stripped of her commander, her path, and even her reason to breathe. <strong>"What does 'I love you' mean?"</strong>

  <div class="arc-content text-lg sm:text-xl leading-relaxed text-ink/80 dark:text-white/80 space-y-8">
    <p class="fade-in-up">
      To decipher the profound enigma of the Major's final words, Violet chose an unimaginable path: becoming an "Auto Memories Doll" at the C.H Postal Company. An elegant ghostwriter transforming raw emotions into words onto parchment. Ironically, her initial letters lacked empathy, reading like rigid military reports.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-up">
      Yet, through the relentless clatter of typewriter keys, Violet navigated the vast landscapes of human emotion. She met broken and pure hearts alike: witnessing Princess Charlotte discover true devotion; sharing playwright Oscar Webster's grief; and shedding her first tears writing fifty future letters for a dying mother, Clara.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-up italic opacity-80 border-t border-ink/20 dark:border-white/20 pt-6 mt-6">
      With every single letter written, Violet's conscience was violently pried open, illuminating the harrowing reality of how many cold hands she had severed on the battlefield. She realized she was "burning."

    <p class="fade-in-up">
      The suffocating weight of her sins crushed her spirit. Violet briefly refused to even touch an envelope, believing bloodstained hands had no right to weave love. However, upon reading letters of profound gratitude sent by the very clients she had touched, Violet comprehended an absolute truth.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-up font-bold text-accent dark:text-gold">
      Her past could never be erased, but the beautiful letters she writes for the future would lovingly conceal those scars.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-up">
      The ultimate testament to her growth occurred during a violent hijacking on a train bound for Drossel. Violet fought not as a soldier ordered to kill, but as a guardian ordered to protect.

    <p class="fade-in-up">
      Seasons turned and faded away. As human civilization marched relentlessly forward, erecting towering radio towers, the classic era of handwritten letters slowly eroded. Whispers of a faint clue carried Violet across the vast ocean to the remote Ecarte Island.
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-up">
      Major Gilbert was alive; exiled in the abyss of guilt for robbing a young girl's smile on a battlefield long past. Even when Gilbert's door remained firmly shut to her amidst a raging storm, Violet chose to lean on the power of words.
    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl font-heading italic text-ink dark:text-white border-l-4 border-accent dark:border-gold pl-6 fade-in-up">
      "Spring, summer, autumn, winter... How many seasons have passed by alone. I am waiting for you, Major."
    </p>
    <p class="fade-in-up">
      They reunited beneath the moonlight. No longer bound as a weapon and her master, but as two fragile souls eternally grounding each other through true, unconditional love.
