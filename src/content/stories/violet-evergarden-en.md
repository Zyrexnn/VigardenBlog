<div class="story-section introduction">
  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>In a world recovering from a great war that divided the northern and southern continents, there was a young girl known only as a "weapon." She possessed no emotions, no desires of her own, and lived solely to obey orders. Her name was Violet Evergarden.</p>

  <summary>The Beginning: Last Words</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>On a brutal battlefield, Violet lost both her arms while trying to save the only person who treated her as a human being: Major Gilbert Bougainvillea. As the building collapsed around them and enemies closed in, a gravely wounded Gilbert pushed Violet away.</p>
    <p>With his dying breath, Gilbert spoke words that Violet could not comprehend at the time: <em>"Live... and be free. From the bottom of my heart... I love you."</em></p>
    <p>Violet survived, waking up in a hospital with cold metallic prosthetic arms. However, Major Gilbert was declared missing in action. Without orders and without her master, Violet lost her purpose in life. She did not understand what "Love" meant. Why did the Major say that? What is that feeling?</p>

  <summary>The Middle: Becoming an Auto Memories Doll</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>To understand Gilbert's final words, Violet decided to work at the CH Postal Company as an "Auto Memories Doll" — a scribe who writes letters for others. Initially, Violet's letters were stiff and report-like. She could not grasp the nuances of human emotion.</p>
    <p>However, through various encounters with clients, Violet's heart slowly began to thaw:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Luculia</strong>, who wanted to express gratitude to her brother who was disabled by the war.</li>
      <li><strong>Princess Charlotte</strong>, who exchanged public love letters with a prince from another country, teaching Violet about the sincerity behind beautiful words.</li>
      <li><strong>Leon</strong>, a lonely astronomer, who made Violet realize the loneliness of being left behind.</li>
      <li><strong>Oscar Webster</strong>, a playwright who lost his daughter. Violet helped him finish his play, and in the process, she learned about the grief of losing a child and the hope of reuniting, even if only in dreams.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The turning point was when Violet wrote 50 letters for a dying mother, Clara, addressed to her daughter, Ann, in the future. Violet held back her tears during the assignment but broke down afterwards, realizing the heavy weight of the love the mother was leaving behind. Here, Violet finally realized that she herself was "burning" from her past as a soldier who had taken many lives.</p>

  <summary>The Climax: Acceptance and Forgiveness</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Violet was haunted by guilt. She felt that her hands, which had taken so many lives, did not deserve to write letters that brought people together. However, the letters she had delivered proved otherwise. People were grateful to her.</p>
    <p>During a train hijacking incident, Violet fought not to kill, but to protect. She refused to use weapons, using her metal arms to deflect attacks to save the passengers. She finally accepted that her past could not be erased, but her future could still be written.</p>
    <p>She eventually met Major Gilbert's mother, who asked her to live on and not forget Gilbert. Violet realized that the "Love" Gilbert gave her was the light guiding her out of the darkness.</p>

  <summary>The Ending: Letter to the Major (Movie)</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Years passed. Technology advanced, radio towers were built, and the profession of the Doll slowly began to become obsolete. But the name Violet Evergarden remained legendary. A clue led Violet to the remote island of Ecarté, where Gilbert was actually alive, hiding because of his guilt for making Violet a weapon and losing his own eye and arm.</p>
    <p>Initially, Gilbert refused to see Violet, feeling she would be happier without him. However, Violet wrote one last letter to him. Not as a report, but as the outpouring of a heart of a girl in love.</p>
    <p><em>"Spring, summer, autumn, and winter... How many seasons have passed alone? I am waiting for you, Major."</em></p>
    <p>Gilbert, moved by Violet's sincerity and his brother's encouragement, finally chased after Violet. They met in the sea under the moonlight. Violet, who had been holding back her tears all this time, could finally cry in the arms of the person she loved most. This time, not as an order, but as a reunion of two souls completing each other.</p>
    <p>Violet continued to live on the island with Gilbert, continuing to write letters as a local postal service, while her legacy as a Doll was remembered forever through a stamp bearing her face.</p>
