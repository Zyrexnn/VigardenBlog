## The Weight of Metal Hands

Before I became an Auto Memories Doll, I was a weapon. My hands — these mechanical prosthetics gifted to me by Professor Orlando — were instruments of destruction. Now they hold a pen instead of a rifle.

The transition was not easy.

### From Soldier to Scribe

When the Great War between Leidenschaftlich and Gardarik ended, many soldiers found themselves lost. We had been trained to fight, and now the world demanded that we **feel**.

The CH Postal Company gave me purpose:

1. **Listen** to the client's heart
2. **Translate** their emotions into words
3. **Deliver** the letter across any distance

### The Letters That Haunt Me

Some letters are harder to write than others. A widow asking me to pen a letter to her fallen husband. A child dictating words to a father who will never return. These are the moments when I understand that words carry more power than any weapon.

> "Letters are not just ink on paper. They are fragments of the soul, delivered across time and space."

The war taught me destruction. The letters teach me creation.
