## Dear Reader,

The candlelight flickers as I put pen to paper. At the CH Postal Company, we Auto Memories Dolls are trained to transcribe the feelings of our clients into beautiful prose. Yet, I find myself struggling with the simplest of phrases.

> "I love you."

Major Gilbert once said those words to me. At the time, I did not understand their meaning. Now, after writing hundreds of letters for clients across Leidenschaftlich, I believe I am beginning to comprehend.

### What I Have Learned

Each letter I write teaches me something new:

- **A mother's letter to her daughter** — Love can be patient, spanning years and lifetimes.
- **A playwright's confession** — Love can be dramatic, burning bright and fierce.
- **A soldier's farewell** — Love can be quiet, hidden between the lines.

I will continue to write. I will continue to search for the meaning behind those words.
